<p>Hello,<br>
This project was created by Jonathan Martinez for the purpose learning about alpha-beta pruning.
For those curious, it was the main algorithim used in chess engines for a while. The idea
is pretty simple, explore lines of play until you find the best variation. If you find that
there is a refutation to your move, then move onto anouther line of play. The game state is kept track of by
64 bit bitsets, each representing a square on the board.

<br>
The heursitic is a bit of a work in progress, but feel free to make some moves and see what the engine suggests.
